# [FINISHED] Difference equation order
Application for evaluating difference equation and definition of it's order

If application is started with console arguments, every equation is evaluated

If application is started without console arguments, the equation can be read from console

Supported formats of the equation (all spaces are ignored):

	3*d^2u(x+h)-2,1*du(x)

	d3u(x-2h)+u(x+3*h)

	-du(x+2h)+9*u(x-h)-1.3d^4u(x-7*h)
